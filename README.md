# Natural Language Processing

## Introduction
This is the assignment of Natural Language Processing Course at HCMUT. There are two assignments.

Customer service (CS) is an important part of all companies that sell products. In this assignment, we consider the context in which the CS will proactively call customers to offer products.

## Assignment 1
Write the parser and lexer rules for the context described, then generate sentences from those rules. From the generated sentences, once again parse those sentence. 
+ The *main* is in [app/main1.py](app/main1.py)
+ The rule is in [data/rule.xlsx](data/rule.xlsx)
+ Output: [output/grammar.txt](output/grammar.txt), [output/parse-results.txt](output/parse-results.txt), [output/samples.txt](output/samples.txt)

## Assignment 2
1 - Build a parser of dependency grammar

2 - Parse and output semantic relationships of queries

3 - Create grammatical relationships

4 - Create logical form and procedural semantics

5 - Retrieve the database to find information and answer the queries.

+ The *main* is in [app/main2.py](app/main2.py)
+ Input: [input](input)
+ Output: [output/p2-q-1.txt](output/p2-q-1.txt), [output/p2-q-2.txt](output/p2-q-2.txt), [output/p2-q-3.txt](output/p2-q-3.txt), [output/p2-q-4.txt](output/p2-q-4.txt), [output/p2-q-5.txt](output/p2-q-5.txt).
